# JVM
The JVM is basically a program whose purpose is to execute other programs, more specifically [[Java]] programs.

It has two primary functions:
- allow [[Java]] programs to run on any machine (the so-called *"write once, run anywhere"*)
- manage and optimize memory

It is made up of three aspects: specification, implementation and **instance** (the thing that most people refer to when talking about "the JVM").
