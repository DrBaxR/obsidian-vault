CSS is a language (not programming language) that is used to style websites - the [[Front End]]. 

You can mark [[HTML]] elements with some types of identifiers (classes or ids) by which you can later select them and apply some attributes, which cascade to all the children of the selected elements.

Here is how the syntax of CSS looks like:
```css
p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
} 
```
