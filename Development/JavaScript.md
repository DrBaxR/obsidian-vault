A [[Front End]] technology that is used to make web pages more dynamic. It is the only programming language that is used in the front end and it has multiple browser [[API]]s that it can use (such as the [[DOM]] manipulation API).

By using this technology together with other [[Front End]] technologies such as [[HTML]] and [[CSS]], the developer can produce great experiences for the end user.

It is really common to not use vanilla [[JavaScript]] to develop the [[Front End]] of a web application, since it can lead to long development time. For this reason, people generally use [[Framework]]s or [[Library]]s to develop their applications.
