It is something that gets used on [[Web]]. A good analogy for authorization is is a movie ticket, particularly in the old days: Anyone with a ticket can get into the movie theatre; one could sell it around, because the identity of the person that bought it **does not matter here**.

In the same way, concert tickets or passes can be sold to other people easily because they are used only checking the authorization to enter the venue.

Together with [[Authentication]], authorization is used to secure certain aspects of web applications. A popular protocol for authorization is [[OAuth]].
