# Java
Java is a programming language that can be used to create programs which run on a virtual machine called the [[JVM]], which is platform independent. In order to achieve this, Java code first compiles into bytecode which is then run by the JVM.

In order to develope a Java program, you first need to install a [[JDK]] locally and use it to develop your application. To make the whole development process simpler, people tend to use build tools like [[Maven]].

After you wrote your code, you need to use the Java compiler to compile your `.java` source files into `.class` files, which contain bytecode. These files need to be later packaged into a [[JAR]], which can then be run on the [[JVM]].
