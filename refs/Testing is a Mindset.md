# Testing is a Mindset
The reason why software development and QA teams are separate si because the way they view an application is completely different: developers *build* things while the QA team *breaks* them.

As feature requests of bugs come in, the first thing that your team should be thinking is how you are going to be testing them. It is really important to include the QA team in these discussions, since they can provide great input, usch as the **test cases that they would expect to run against this new feature**, which can then be translated in automated tests by the developers.

If there is no QA team, a good way to start with the end goald and work backwards: *What does this new feature need to do? Once you understand that, you can break that problem down into small incremental steps, and translate those steps into tests.*
