Here are some possible control schemes that I've come up with for multi character control. They are mainly focused on the movement aspect.

## Dual control real-time
The idea is that you control the squirel with one half of the keyboard (WASD) and the knight with the other half (IJKL).

**Advantages:**
- Maximum control over both characters

**Disadvantages:**
- It sounds like a hassle to control two characters at once
- It may be lead to not fun/too hard gameplay
- Does'n really add up with the story, since the knight is supposed to be a dumbass

## Single control AI-assisted
You control the squirrel with WASD and target enemies (with mouse, for example). You can target one enemy at a time and the knight has some AI that tells him to fight that enemy.

**Advantages:**
- Simple to control
- Makes sense from the story's poerspective

**Disadvantages:**
- Hard to map controls to a controller layout
- I feel like gameplay might be too simple
- High risk to feel too disconnected/not very engaging

## Single control tactical
Pretty much same idea as [[#Single control AI-assisted]], only difference being that you have more control over the actions that the knight takes via something like a tactical menu/control wheel.

For example, you can have a control wheel with actions like *attack*, *defend* and *special* (or whatever else) and pick out of these, each of them having a cooldown or something; and when you pick an action the knight will do it on the targetted enemy (or maybe engage in additional targetting).

**Note:** Advantages and disadvantages are added to the ones of [[#Single control AI-assisted]].

**Advantages:**
- More engaging gameplay

**Disadvantages:**
- Even harder to map to controller

## Single control toggle
You fully control one character at a time and are able to switch between which one it is. There are two variations that I see to this one:

### Option 1
While you control squirrel (which has a supportive role), the knight has some basic AI that will do something extremely simple (maybe target and attack nearest enemy to him - and possibly even do some real dumb shit like throw his weapon away).

While you control the knight (which has an offensive role), the squirrel is stuck in place (maybe a fun little touch would be to add something like a speech bubble which displays which keys you press, as if the squirrel tells the knight exactly what to do - which can maybe be used as a reason why squirrel can't move).

### Option 2
While you control either of the characters, the other one follows you in close proximity and has some AI with basic behavior (for squirrel it heals when knight is low, randomly buffs and stuff like that; for knight it attacks when enemy near).

This option feels more boring to me.

**Advantages:**
- Engaging gameplay
- Allows mechanical depth
- Lines up with the story
- Easy to map to controller

**Disadvantages:**
- I don't see many (at least for [[#Option 1]])
