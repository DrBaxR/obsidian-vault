It is a collection of [[Java]] libraries for writing [[Microservice]]s that run on a fast web core. Helidon has 2 "flavors": [[Helidon SE]] and [[Helidon MP]]. They are bots [[Framework]]s that provide similar functionality but offer different developer experiences.

[[Helidon MP]] is built on top of [[Helidon SE]] libraries and provides a familiar experience to [[Jakarta EE]] (it is an implementation of the [[MicroProfile]] specification) developers.
