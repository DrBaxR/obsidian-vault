# Ethereum
The Ehtereum network is made up of nodes. Each node represents some client software that anyone can run on their computer, however some minimal requirements are recommended.

**Note:** Running a node is not equivalent with staking. Running a node can just be done so that you make sure that you are the one in control of the data that gets processed, you help the community etc. etc.

### Staking
Staking lets you lock up a part of your funds in order to help secure the network. Besides nodes, in the Ethereum ecosystem there are also entities known as validators, which require a certain amount of ETH staked (32) in order to do their work.

### Smart Contracts
They are computer programs that are stored on the blockchain and run on the blockchain in a decentralized manner. They can be triggered via a transaction on the network and the way they are written is to enact if-then logic.

There are many advantages over regular contracts: they execute automatically when certain conditions are met; they have predictable outcomes - since they are written in code, no need for humans to interpret them adding (like traditional contracts, which are ambiguous); etc.

Smart contracts are an Ethereum account, which means they have a balance and can be a target of transactions. They **can't** be deleted and the transactions they make are irreversible.

### Oracles
By design, smart contracts can only access data that is on blockchain. What this means is that you can't access stuff like "what is the weather in X" from a smart contract.

Oracles are the solution to this problem which would otherwise be pretty limiting in what you can do with a smart contract. These oracles are not something that Ethereum implements itself, but they are separate projects that live on the Ethereum network (one example of an oracles project is [[Chainlink]]).

### Networks
Ethereum is a network of networks. These "layer 2" networks aim to improve its speed and costs while relying on its security.
