# Web3
It represents the next evolution of the internet. If Web1 was read-only, Web2 is read-write then Web3 is read-write own.

Its main goals are to be decentralized so you don't have to trust a central entity for the assets you own, and to be as secure as possible (required because of the first goal).

### How do I interact with Web3
By using a wallet.

### Coins vs. Tokens
Coins are the currency that is native to a network, whereas tokens can exist on any network.

### What is a network
A network is something like an ecosystem in Web3.

### Since Web3 is decentralized, does that mean that all the nodes have a copy of the whole blockchain
Yes.

### What is a blockchain
A database that keeps track of the transactions that happen in a network.
