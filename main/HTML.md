A [[Front End]] technology that can be used to lay out the structure of a page. The structure of an HTML document is a hierarchical one and its layout can be used by using tags. After the layout of the page was specified via HTML, you can use [[CSS]] to style it and [[JavaScript]] to make it more dynamic.

The tags have this structure: `<tag></tag>`. And an example of a HTML document looks a little like this:
```html
<!DOCTYPEÂ html>  
<html>  
	<head>  
		<title>Page Title</title>  
	</head>  
	<body>  
		<h1>My First Heading</h1>  
		<p>My first paragraph.</p>  
	</body>  
</html>
```
