# Internet
The internet is basically a network of networks. This is also where its name comes from: **inter** **net**work.

Computers are connected to local networks to which they send data. The local networks then forward the data in the internet to the destination.

**SOHO network** = small office/home office network

There are two types of devices:
1. End user devices: the devices that the users use
2. Intermediary devices: the devices that deal with the process of making sure that the message/data an end user devices sends reaches its destination

The internet is generally drawn nas a cloud in diagrams because we you don't really know/need to know how it looks like. You only know how your little part of it looks like (your local network).

**Protocols** are basically a set of **rules** that everyone in the internet agrees upon so that all devices can cooperate.
