# Container
A [[Docker]] [[Container]] is a way to package an application and all of its dependencies in a single place, which is **portable**.

They should not be confused with the [[Docker Image]]s, since containers are the thing that are running and images are the things that are being moved around.

There are many things you can do with containers, since they are *lightweight VMs*. For example you can see the logs of a container, expose ports of containers and even connect to the terminal of said container.
