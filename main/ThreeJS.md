# ThreeJS
Three JS is a [[JavaScript]] library that can be used for 3D experiences in the borwser. It is built as a further abstraction on top of [[WebGL]].

The first things that you need to do are to create a scene, a camera and a renderer. The renderer uses the camera to render the scene.

The scene contains objects (meshes). These meshes are made up of two main components: the geometry and the material. The geometry contains all the information about the vertices and the faces of the object and the material contains things like the color of the object.
