Authentication is a procedure that is used on [[Web]], which is used along with [[Authorization]] to secure certain aspects of applications.

A good analogy for authentication is showing your driving license to the police to confirm your identity, that you are actually the person you are claiming to be. The cop will verify your identity by checking your information, such as biological characteristics and your photo, and can question if they doubt any of these things.

In the same way, while logging in through Google OAuth, Google is the cop outside the airport trying to identify you by checking your username and password, along with additional factors like MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).

When you prove your identity with the above methods, the cop gives you an “access token”, say, a virtual entry pass to the airport to access various airport resources.

A popular solution for authentication is [[OpenID]].
