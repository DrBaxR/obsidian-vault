# API
An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate between each other. In other words, ***an API is a way for a piece of software to provide services to another piece of software***.

This concept can be put in contrast with [[User Interface]]s, which connect computers with users.

The calls that make up the API are called subroutines, methods, requests, or endpoints. An API _defines_ these calls (their structure), hiding the complexity behind their implementation from the client piece of software.

These APIs have many different use cases and can be found in many shapes and sizes. Here are some examples: [[Library]]s and [[Framework]]s; operating systems and [[Web]] APIs (such as [[RESTful API]]s).
