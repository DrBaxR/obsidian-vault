# Maven Archetype
Archetypes are basically templates that represent a quickstart to a new project type ([[Helidon MP]], for example has its own archetype).

These archetypes are simple projects that showcase some features of the technology that they are made for and some good practices of how you should use said technology.

To create a project from an archetype use `mvn archetype:generate`.
