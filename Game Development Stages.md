# Game Development Stages
The general stages of developing a game:
- Planning
- Pre-Production
- Production
- Testing
- Pre-Launch
- Launch
- Post-Launch

## Planning
Questions to ask before launching in development:
- What genre will the game be?
- Will the game be 2D or 3D
- What art style will the game use?
- What gameplay mechanics do you want to include?
- Who's the hero and who's the villain?
- What game engine will you use?

### Proof of concept
This is the final part of the planning stage - it determines what resources are needed to bring the game to life. Here are the questions that *need* to be answered by the **proof of concept**:
- How much will it cost to make this game?
- How will you get the money you need?
- How long will this game take to make?
- Do you have all the skills you need to make this game, or will you need to hire a team?
- If you need to hire a team, how big will the team be and what roles do they need to fill?
- How will you monetise your game?
- Which platforms will you publish to?

## Pre-Production
Phase where you weight up all aspects of the game, both as a standalone entity and a cog in a greater machine.

This is the time to make storyboards and prototypes.

## Production
Stage where the development happens: developers, designers, animators, sound designers, writers.

## Testing
Here, you test for game bugs and also you make sure that your game is **fun**.

## Pre-launch
Here is where marketing kicks into gear. By now you should have a stable beta build of your game that's ready to present to the public.

Here you can collect a lot of feedback and make some final adjustments before launching the game.

## Launch
The final change you got to give your game a final coat of polish.

## Post-launch
After you have launched your game, there are still a couple of things that you can do:
- Bug fixes
- DLC
- Free content updates
- Game-balancing patches
